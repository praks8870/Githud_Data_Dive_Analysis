Intrusion-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-Machine-Learning,GrannyProgramming,"Network related services, programs and applications are developing greatly, however, network security breaches are also developing with them. Network security is an evolving, challenging and a critical task. It is essential that there is a system in place to identify any harmful movement happening in network. An Intrusion detection system (IDS) has become the prerequisite software addressing cyber security in the modern era. Especially, with the greater complexity of advanced cyber-attacks and as such the uncertainty surrounding the detection of the types of attacks. This thesis proposes a novel approach using an ensemble of K-Means and Gaussian Mixture clustering combined with a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm. When compared with traditional artificial neural network’s (ANN’s) used within an IDS, our approach implements modern advances in deep learning such as initialising the parameters through the unsupervised pre-training clustering ensemble, therefore improving the detection accuracy. We hope our results will show that the proposed approach can provide a real-time response to the attack with a greatly increased detection ratio for false flags.",https://github.com/GrannyProgramming/Intrusion-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-Machine-Learning,Jupyter Notebook,2019-08-08T00:27:51Z,2024-09-28T06:49:41Z,16,4,7,MIT License

pynlpl,proycon,"PyNLPl, pronounced as 'pineapple', is a Python library for Natural Language Processing. It contains various modules useful for common, and less common, NLP tasks. PyNLPl can be used for basic tasks such as the extraction of n-grams and frequency lists, and to build simple language model. There are also more complex data types and algorithms. Moreover, there are parsers for file formats common in NLP (e.g. FoLiA/Giza/Moses/ARPA/Timbl/CQL). There are also clients to interface with various NLP specific servers. PyNLPl most notably features a very extensive library for working with FoLiA XML (Format for Linguistic Annotation).",https://github.com/proycon/pynlpl,Python,2010-07-06T11:42:27Z,2024-09-03T07:28:34Z,479,67,3,GNU General Public License v3.0
